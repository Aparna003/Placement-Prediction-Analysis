This analysis shows Explorative Data Analysis and developing a prediction model that predicts whether a student gets placed or not depending on the various independent 
attributes like CGPA, Internships taken, No of backlogs, etc. on the CollegePlace dataset. By implementing data cleaning, encoding the categorical values, and scaling the numerical
values data wrangling is performed followed by which a binomial logistic regression model is used to train and test to predict whether the student gets placement or not.
